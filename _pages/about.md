Hello world! My name is Krisna, a PhD student in Natural Language Processing at MBZUAI fortunately advised by [Prof. Kentaro Inui](https://kentaro-inui.github.io/) and [Dr. Lijie Hu](https://lijie-hu.github.io/). My research encompasses interpretability of language model (with main focus on training dynamic or learning in general), and explainable AI (XAI). Specifically, my main research is to interpret the language models over the course of training to enable better learning approach either empirically by using interpretability or theoretically. 
You can reach out to me through `mahardika.ihsani@mbzuai.ac.ae` or `krisnaihsani@gmail.com`.

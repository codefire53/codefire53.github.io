Hello world! My name is Krisna with pseudonym "codefire53", an M.Sc student majoring Natural Language Processing at MBZUAI. My research interests lie in multilinguality (esp low-resource language, dialects, cross-lingual universality, and code-switching), cognitive science x computational linguistics， representation learning, and interpretability. My grand goal of my research is to propose better learning paradigm or model arhitecture grounded from linguistics and/or cognitive science that could generalize well to underrepresented languages while making them more interpretable as well. Thus i believe those interests are relevant to achieve my grand goal of research and this direction could make language technologies to be more equitable and pushing towards the AGI/ASI goal by increasing the linguistics competence of language models.   I am very honored to be supervised by [Prof. Thamar Solorio](http://solorio.uh.edu/) and [Dr. Muhammed Abdul-Mageed](https://mageed.arts.ubc.ca/).

Hello world! My name is Krisna with pseudonym "codefire53", an M.Sc student majoring Natural Language Processing at MBZUAI. My research interests lie in multilinguality (esp low-resource language and dialects), code-switching, cultural alignment, and efficient learning for NLP tasks. I am very honored to be supervised by [Prof. Thamar Solorio](http://solorio.uh.edu/).

You can reach out to me through `mahardika.ihsani@mbzuai.ac.ae` or `krisnaihsani@gmail.com`.

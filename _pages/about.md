Hello world! My name is Krisna with pseudonym "codefire53", an M.Sc student majoring Natural Language Processing at MBZUAI. My research interests lie in multilinguality (esp low-resource language, dialects, and code-switching), representation learning, and interpretability. My grand goal of my research is to propose better learning paradigm (that might also ground linguistic heuristics) or model arhitecture that could generalize well to underrepresented languages where scaling doesn't work and producing representation that can be disentangled easily enabling more efficient alignment on different values. Thus i believe those interests are relevant to achieve my grand goal of research.   I am very honored to be supervised by [Prof. Thamar Solorio](http://solorio.uh.edu/) and [Dr. Muhammed Abdul-Mageed](https://mageed.arts.ubc.ca/).

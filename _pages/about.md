Hello world! My name is Krisna, a PhD student in Natural Language Processing at MBZUAI. My research encompasses interpretability of language and multimodal language models (with main focus on training dynamic or learning in general), and explainable AI (XAI). Specifically, my research is to interpret the blackbox language models over the course of training to enable better approach for representation learning and also designing performant explainable and controllable language models to enable such models to be "debuggable" easily by researchers just like a computer programme.
You can reach out to me through `mahardika.ihsani@mbzuai.ac.ae` or `krisnaihsani@gmail.com`.
